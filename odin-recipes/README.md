**The Odin Recipe**

In this project I will build a *basic* recipe website.
Once this project is completed I will have demonstrated
how to create the basic structure of a website using
**HTML** paragraph, heading, strong and emphasis elements.

In addition to the above, I will have demonstrated how I
use links to other pages on my website and external websites.
I will also have shown how I incorporate images into the
website.
