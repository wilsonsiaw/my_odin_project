**The Odin Recipe**

In this project I will build a *basic* recipe website.
Once this project is completed I will have demonstrated
how to create the basic structure of a website using
**HTML** paragraph and heading elements. I will also show how 
I use anchor elements, image elements, unordered lists and
ordered lists to create the website.

The website has a homepage (index.html) and links to other pages 
on the wbesite. These pages are mainly pages to easy to make
recipes I found on the internet.
